# Passenger Counter App

This is a passenger counter app built with JavaScript.

It counts how many passengers have entered the subway at a stop, saves that number
and displays it on the screen. Each time that number is saved,
the counter resets.

## Demo

The project has been deployed on GitHub Pages and can be launched inside a browser.
